Current college alcohol safety training is failing students because it's disconnected from real scenarios they face. We're building 'The Drinking Game - But Not That Kind,' an interactive decision-based simulation that lets students practice alcohol safety in realistic situations.
The platform uses a choice-driven narrative with 27 unique endings, letting users explore consequences of different decisions without actual risk. Students navigate scenarios like peer pressure, determining if friends need medical attention, and managing unsafe situations.
We built this as a web-based visual novel using HTML, JS, and CSS, with branching narrative paths that adapt based on user choices. Each ending provides concrete feedback on decision-making and relevant campus resources.
The key differentiator is application versus memorization. Instead of just knowing the signs of alcohol poisoning, students actively practice identifying them in context. This bridges the gap between knowing safety information and actually using it when needed.
